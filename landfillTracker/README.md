<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

There are many resources that exist that provide information on the lifecyle of waste; however, I didn't find one that showed what the accumulation of our own waste would look like. It is so easy to forget about the impact we have on the evironment. We throw our trash away every day, but that doesnt mean it has magically dissapeared. It has just been moved to another location, where it still has to decompose and break down. Some products take hundreds of years, some take even thousands. But in first world countries with prestige waste management, we never directly see our impact. It is easy to keep over-consuming when we dont have to keep the garbage with us. Can you image what your backyard would look like if that was your own personal landfill. The amount of items still decomposing would be very suprising to most. The goal is to log your waste and show how long it will be until it is gone, and how much space it is taking up. Ideally, this will inform users of their impact and help them take a big step into a more environmentally friendly life style.

Main Goals For This App:
* Look at your trash and understand what it is. 
* Items can really add up and make a big difference. 
* Teach ways for improvement.

## Getting Started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
